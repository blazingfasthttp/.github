## Hi there 👋

🙋‍ This is blazingfasthttp.com, a personal software packaging project for high-performance HTTP server software for Enterprise Linux distributions. Currently, I'm targeting only nginx and third-party modules may evolve later to Varnish and other related stuffs.

So :
- I provide RPM packages for NGINX and 3rd party modules
- Current target distribution are CentOS and AlmaLinux (CloudLinux and other RHEL based distro should be compatible too)
- RPM are hosted on a public repository accessible for free

## Why blazingfasthttp.com?
Because I didn't found any **free** nginx repository providing ModSecurity. I decided to make it. As simple as it.

## Contribution guidelines
I never maintained open-source project previously. Be kind, don't hesitate to make *useful* remarks in issues reporting. As this is a simple side-project and I have full-time job besides, I'm do my best for maintaining but don't expect to have a 24/7 support. 😛
